## 1、查询"01"课程比"02"课程成绩高的学生的信息及课程分数
* 查询每个人对应的01科目的成绩
```mysql
select a.*,b.s_score as 01_score 
from 
Student as a 
join 
Score as b 
on a.s_id=b.s_id and b.c_id='01';
```
* 查询每个人对应的02科目的成绩
```mysql
select a.*,b.s_score as 02_score 
from 
Student as a 
join 
Score as b 
on a.s_id=b.s_id and b.c_id='02';
```
* 查询每个人对应的01科目的成绩高于02科目的成绩
```mysql
select aa.*,bb.02_score 
from 
(
select a.*,b.s_score as 01_score 
from 
Student as a 
join 
Score as b 
on a.s_id=b.s_id and b.c_id='01'
) as aa 
left join 
(
select a.*,b.s_score as 02_score 
from 
Student as a 
join 
Score as b 
on a.s_id=b.s_id and b.c_id='02'
) as bb 
on aa.s_id=bb.s_id where aa.01_score>bb.02_score;
```
* result
```sql
+------+----------+------------+-------+----------+----------+
| s_id | s_name   | s_birth    | s_sex | 01_score | 02_score |
+------+----------+------------+-------+----------+----------+
| 02   | qiandian | 1990-12-21 | nan   |       70 |       60 |
| 04   | liyun    | 1990-08-06 | nan   |       50 |       30 |
+------+----------+------------+-------+----------+----------+
```
### 标准答案
```sql
select a.* ,b.s_score as 01_score,c.s_score as 02_score 
from 
Student a 
join 
Score b on a.s_id=b.s_id and b.c_id='01'
left join 
Score c on a.s_id=c.s_id and c.c_id='02' or c.c_id = NULL where b.s_score>c.s_score;
```
